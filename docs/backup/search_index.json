The goal of this tutorial is to help scientists to (1) see why its important to start using Markdown consistently at various context of their own projects and (2) start using markdown What is Markdown? It is a markup language (albeit a lightweight one) that can be rendered into formatted text. The nice thing about markdown in particular is its readability even when it is not formatted. In short, Markdown as pure text is very readable and organized, can be converted into pretty documents or webpage! See Markdown Guide for basic syntax. When would scientists use markdown? 1. README files A README file is a text file that explains your project/code/package. It should contain information that is required for users who are not the author to understand and use what the README is explaining. For more info on how and why to create a README file: https://www.makeareadme.com/ 2. Analysis workbook such as R Markdown and Jupyter notebook uses markdown Modern analysis softwares often comes with a way to create presentatble workbook that merges your code and text in one document. This is often achieved by using markdown. Knowing the in-and-outs of markdown will help you format the analysis you will share with others! Common Markdown usage in analysis softwares R Markdown Python Jupyter notebook Matlab livescript can be converted to markdown 3. Make a webpage! A Markdown file can be easily converted into an html webpage, which lends itself to be a good tool for blogging, or even making a full fledge webpage. You can make a personal webpage highlighting your work! Or an easy webpage that contains all the necessary info for a project that you want to share with others. Using R Markdown or Bookdown to make a website Make an easy website with a bunch of markdowns using a github page "],
["encourages-open-source-and-open-science.html", "Encourages open source and open science", " Encourages open source and open science Markdown encourages you to organize your README to be systematically readable to a stranger, even in pure text form. It is rendered to be pretty and even more readable by common tools (e.g., Github). Markdown is used in sharing workbooks that combines text and codes, which is one of the best way to ensure reproducable analyses. These are both practices important to encourage open science practices. Open science is a movement to make data, samples, software and all things related to a scientific finding as transparent and easy to access as possible. There are pros and cons to an open and closed system, which is not a topic that can be adequately covered here (for more info, checkout Center for Open Science). However, given a common goal of wanting more people to understand, reproduce, and build on top of previous work, an ‘open’ approach to your code with good documentation is is certainly a good place to start!
